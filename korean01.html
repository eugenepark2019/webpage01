<h1>Hanok (Traditional Korean House)</h1>
<h2>A place of subtle beauty and quiet dignity</h2>
<p>Korean hanok bring the natural world inside, allowing its human residents to coexist peacefully<br>
 with the simplicity, beauty and spirit of nature.</p>

<h2>Ondol and maru: A unique architectural relationship</h2>
<p>Both a huge, 99-room tile-roofed house and a small, three-room thatch or oak bark-roofed mud hut are counted as hanok (traditional Korean house).<br>
 This is because while there may be differences in material, size or structure, all homes that are equipped with ondol (an underfloor heating system)<br>
 and maru (a wide wooden floor area) are considered hanok. Ondol is an underfloor heating system that originated in homes in northern regions with<br>
 a continental climate, while the maru is a structure for cooling that originated in homes in southern regions with an oceanic climate.</p>

<div class="kor01">
<p>During the hot summer, Koreans mostly stay on the maru, while they spend time in rooms warmed by ondol in the winter.<br>
 The wood that forms the maru and the fire that makes ondol possible are incompatible. Because wood is vulnerable to fire, <br>
 no architect in the world places these two elements together. However, due to the Korean peninsula's circulating pattern of<br>
 cold and dry air in winter and hot and humid air in summer, the Korean people were forced to develop a method in which both <br>
 heating and cooling could coexist. Therefore, hanok have been built since antiquity with both maru and ondol—adaptable to both heat and cold.<br>
 This coexistence makes hanok an extremely science-based architecture unprecedented anywhere in the world.</p>

<h2>Earth, trees and hanji: Building a house from nature</h2>
<p>The traditional architecture of most countries makes use of materials like wood, earth and stone that are easily found<br>
 in the surrounding natural environment. The hanok was no exception. Wood was used for its pillars and maru, stone for the gudeul<br>
 (heating device of ondol), and clay for the floors and walls. Of these materials, the hanok used a particularly large quantity of clay,<br>
 applying it not only to the walls but also to the roof. The clay is what makes hanok cool in the summer and warm in the winter with its <br>
 innate heating and cooling properties.</p>

<div class="kor01">
<p>Another unique feature of hanok is its use of hanji—traditional Korean paper that is made from the bark of the mulberry tree—on <br>
every flat surface inside the home, including walls, doors, the ceiling and even the floor. Hanji was pasted on doors due to its excellent<br>
 insulating capacity and its transparency—it not only kept the room warm but also let in sunlight. Hanji does not have the closed structure of glass;<br>
 rather, it has air holes that make ventilation of the entire home possible without having to always open the doors. Hanji also adjusts humidity levels <br>
 by absorbing excess moisture in the air and evaporating it when the air is dry. It even traps floating dust particles, acting as an air purifier.<br>
 With all of these features, the hanok is not only eco-friendly but brings nature itself directly into the home in the forms of light, air and even sound</p>

<h2>Hanok: the pure beauty of empty space</h2>
<p>Koreans learned the value of life from their everyday interactions with nature. Indeed, even the direction in which a house was to be built was determined<br>
 in harmony with the surrounding environment. This communion with nature resulted in simple homes without frills, yet not at all destitute. In this way, <br>
 all the natural elements surrounding the house, including wind, grass, fields and the sky, were brought indoors. In other words, hanok was the realization<br>
 of the desirable union between nature, the home, and human beings. It is this adherence to the natural elements that gives the hanok its simple, <br>
 soft beauty coalesced with a dignity and harmony that is absolutely magnificent.</p>

<div class="kor01">
<p>The courtyard of a hanok was not filled with a garden; rather it was intentionally left empty.<br>
 This is because the natural environment surrounding the home was considered its "garden" – all one needed to do was simply open the door.<br>
 The courtyard was also left unfettered based on the idea that by leaving it empty, it would be able to hold all things.<br>
 This is a markedly different concept from Western architecture as well as a departure even within the Eastern cultural spheres from the embellishment <br>
 of Chinese spaces and the artificial beauty of Japanese architectural spaces. Amid the peacefulness and humility of the Korean hanok, <Br>
 there is a decided vitality and elegance.</p>

 <div class="kor01">
<p>Hanok attempts no ostentatious displays. Its subtle beauty and depth can be found in its respect for nature and the virtues of the commonplace.<br>
 Because of the hanok's soft and quiet features, its simplicity may feel forlorn and desolate at times. The hanok has a natural aesthetic that lacks <br>
 any artificial touch. It is this sense of restraint supported by subdued colors that brings out the natural order of the surrounding environment.<br>
 This is a structural beauty based on the organic standardization of the simple line, a simplicity that refuses artificiality and instead seeks out depths<br>
 of meaning in silence. Within the hanok is an essence which attempts to follow and converge with the order of nature.</p>
